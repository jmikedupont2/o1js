Specifically the ones in the o1js and mina infrastructure.
nodejs and the browser runtimes. 

The slowest operations are multiplications that I have seen so far, involved
in the computation of curves with 256 bit fields or group elements of types of polynomials.

My thoughts are to reduce the number of multiplications, choose groups that have additional constraints
of being beautiful and meaningful in thier own right and valuable computer art that embodies
the introspective mindset, goedel escher bach, the meta-meme. We can find beauty in zkps
and optimize the selection of public polynomial.

a BZKP or beautiful zkp is one that has more embedded public information
besides the zero knowledge content. we can consider that the source code and data structures and insights into the open source code can be embedded into the results that make it more valuable than just random data.
